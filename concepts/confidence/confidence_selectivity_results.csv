I am so sick and tired of working with incompetent coworkers. It's like they have no idea what they're doing, and they expect me to pick up the slack. I can't believe how incompetent they are.

Take for example, Jane. She's been working here for years, but she still can't seem to figure out how to use the software. It's like she's willfully ignorant, refusing to learn new things. And don't even get me started on her lack of attention to detail. She's always making mistakes, and it's like she doesn't care.

And then there's John. He's always so confident and arrogant, but he's also completely clueless. He has no idea how to solve problems, and he always relies on me to bail him out. It's like he has no problem asking for help, but he also has no problem taking credit for other people's work.

I'm so tired of working with these people. They're not just incompetent, they're also unprofessional. They have no respect for their colleagues, and they always act like they know what they're doing. It's like they're trying to prove something, but they're not.
